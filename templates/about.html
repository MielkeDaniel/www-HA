    <p class="section-description">
      The DFINITY Foundation is dedicated to bringing people and organizations
      together to learn about and collaborate on the next-generation of
      decentralized applications. The Internet Computer allows developers to
      build dapps that are scaleable, run smart contracts at web speed, and
      serve user experiences directly on chain. We believe in a future in which
      every system and service is rebuilt and reimagined using smart contracts
      and runs entirely from public blockchains without need for traditional IT.
      Weâ€™re committed to connecting those who believe the same through our
      events, content, and discussions.

      <p class="section-description">
        DFINITY believes, that "smart contracts", that run on a public
        blockchain are a vastly superior new form of software. However,
        traditional blockchains provide hosting frameworks for smart contracts
        that are highly limiting. We believe that once these limitations are
        removed by a next generation blockchain, a "blockchain singularity" will
        occur, in which the majority of the world's systems and services will be
        rebuilt entirely from smart contracts. In the process, these systems and
        services will be fundamentally reimagined, changing how our information
        systems, financial systems, economy and society works, by leveraging the
        many new capabilities that smart contracts provide.

      <p class="section-description">
        Our mission is to develop technology that supports the next generation
        Internet Computer blockchain network and ecosystem. Among many firsts,
        the Internet Computer is the first public blockchain that can scale the
        capacity it provides to smart contracts without bound, allowing it to
        process and maintain any amount of data required. It can run smart
        contracts with efficiency approaching that of traditional software,
        while keeping costs low and predictable. It hosts smart contracts that
        run at web speed, and which can serve interactive web content directly
        to end users without intermediaries, providing for the creation of
        systems and services that run entirely from a blockchain. The blockchain
        also runs under the control of an algorithmic governance system and is
        self-directed.
