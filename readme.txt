An admin account is registered in the database. The username and password are both set to "admin." This account type, as defined in the database, grants the ability to perform specific modifications on the website. Other users do not have these privileges, as the corresponding routes in the backend are restricted.

A similar setup exists for the account with the username "DominicWilliams" and the password "1234." This functionality can be accessed via the About page.
